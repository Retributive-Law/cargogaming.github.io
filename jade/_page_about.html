      <p>
        We are a growing community with a variety of servers housing TONS of kickass, new and innovative features!
        Check out cargo to go Fishing on the beach (and get killed), Put security cameras around your base (watch others get killed),
        Goto PVP Enchanted Cargo Events (everyone get's killed), and of course, ride chickens across the map into the sunset.
        Drive by chickens are a thing on Cargo... We are not kidding. If you are new to the game, we have tons of people who readily help,
        as well as tips, starter kits, and more to help you on your Rust Journey! We hope to see you soon! Try not to get killed...
